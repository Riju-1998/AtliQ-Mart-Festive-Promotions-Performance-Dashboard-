AtliQ Mart Festive Promotions Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of festive promotions run by AtliQ Mart, a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. The focus is on evaluating the promotional campaigns conducted during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 for AtliQ branded products. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights to the Sales Director, enabling data-driven decisions for future promotional campaigns by identifying the most and least effective promotions.

Project Objectives
Evaluate the effectiveness of promotions by comparing pre- and post-promotion sales.
Calculate the Incremental Revenue (IR%) and Incremental Sold Units (ISU%) to determine promotional impact.
Provide region-wise sales performance with a focus on the best-performing regions.
Identify top and bottom products based on sales metrics, offering actionable insights for future promotions.
DAX Calculations Used
Baseline Revenue: Measures sales revenue before the promotion started.

DAX
Copy code
Base Line Revenue = SUMX(fact_events, fact_events[Quantity Sold(before_promo)] * fact_events[Base Price])
Incremental Revenue: Calculates the additional revenue generated due to the promotion.

DAX
Copy code
Incremental Revenue = SUMX(fact_events, (fact_events[Quantity Sold(after_promo)] - fact_events[Quantity Sold(before_promo)]) * fact_events[Base Price])
IR% (Incremental Revenue Percentage): Represents the percentage growth in revenue during the promotional period.

DAX
Copy code
IR% = DIVIDE([Incremental Revenue], [Revenue before promo], 0) * 100
ISU% (Incremental Sold Unit Percentage): Indicates the percentage increase in units sold during the promotional period.

DAX
Copy code
ISU% = DIVIDE([Incremental Sold Unit], [Total Quantity before promo], 0) * 100
Revenue Before and After Promotion: Breakdown of revenue pre- and post-promotion.

DAX
Copy code
Revenue Before Promo = SUMX(fact_events, fact_events[Quantity Sold(before_promo)] * fact_events[Base Price])
Revenue After Promo = SUMX(fact_events, fact_events[Quantity Sold(after_promo)] * fact_events[Base Price])
